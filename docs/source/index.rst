TASEL (pronounced TASS-Uhl, like tassel) stands for Totally Awesome Stack Execution Language.
===================================

**TASEL** is a stack-based programming language. Stack-based languages are a type of programming language that operate on a data structure called a stack. In simple terms, a stack is like a pile of objects where you can only interact with the object on the top.

In stack-based languages, you work directly with the stack. You push values onto the stack and perform operations that consume values from the stack and produce new values. The stack follows a "last in, first out" (LIFO) principle, meaning the last value you push onto the stack is the first one you can access or use.

To perform computations, you push the input values onto the stack, then use operators or functions that take values from the stack, perform operations, and push the result back onto the stack.

The beauty of stack-based languages lies in their simplicity and conciseness. They tend to have a compact syntax since they don't require complex control structures, and often skip the parsing process completely. However, they do require a different mindset and understanding of how the stack operates. By leveraging the stack's properties effectively, you can create powerful and efficient programs.

   **TASEL** is currently in Beta phase and under development, but it's available on Replit.
